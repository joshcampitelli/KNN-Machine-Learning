In this deliverable, we have provided the base  
functioning for the machine learning system.    
						
The program is run from the main class, where   
two MachineLearning objects are created.  Each  
MachineLearning object has a Storage object,    
which holds all of out GenericMetric objects.   
						
The main class will then add GenericMetric      
objects to each MachineLearning object.  This   
allows the program to "learn" how to predict a  
price for the particular case.  		
						
Known Issues:					
   - No Known Issues				

The Map Ahead:
  1) Fix the "Magic Value" in EnumMetric	
  2) Implement a GUI
  3) More flexibility (see point 1)
  4) Saving/Loading data
